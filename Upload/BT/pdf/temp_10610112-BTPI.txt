PHP is a server-side scripting language designed for web development but also used as a general-purpose programming language. 
PHP is now installed on more than 244 million websites and 2.1 million web servers.[2] Originally created by Rasmus Lerdorf in 
1995, the reference implementation of PHP is now produced by The PHP Group.[3] While PHP originally stood for Personal Home Page,
[4] it now stands for PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor, a recursive acronym.[5]

PHP code is interpreted by a web server with a PHP processor module, which generates the resulting web page: 
PHP commands can be embedded directly into an HTML source document rather than calling an external file to process data. 
It has also evolved to include a command-line interface capability and can be used in standalone graphical applications.[6]

PHP is free software released under the PHP License, 
which is incompatible with the GNU General Public License (GPL) due to 
restrictions on the usage of the term PHP.[7] PHP can be deployed on most 
web servers and also as a standalone shell on almost every operating system and platform, 
free of charge.[8]


PHP is a scripting language designed to fill the gap between SSI (Server Side Includes) and Perl, 
intended for the web environment. Its principal application is the implementation of web pages having 
dynamic content. PHP has gained quite a following in recent times, and it is one of the frontrunners 
in the Open Source software movement. Its popularity derives from its C-like syntax, and its simplicity. 
PHP is currently divided into two major versions: PHP 4 and PHP 5, although PHP 4 is deprecated and is 
no longer developed or supplied with critical bug fixes. PHP 6 is currently under development.

If you've ever been to a website that prompts you to login, you've probably encountered a server-side 
scripting language. Due to its market saturation, this means you've probably come across PHP. 
PHP was designed by Rasmus Lerdorf to display his resume online and to collect data from his visitors.

Basically, PHP allows a static webpage to become dynamic. "PHP" is an acronym that stands for 
"PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor". The word "Preprocessor" means that PHP makes changes before 
the HTML page is created. This enables developers to create powerful applications which 
can publish a blog, remotely control hardware, or run a powerful website such as Wikipedia 
or Wikibooks. Of course, to accomplish something such as this, you need a 
database application such as MySQL.
